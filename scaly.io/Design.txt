Memory Management
-----------------

Scaly uses 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management[region-based memory management]
where objects live on the stack. No heap is used, and therefore, neither garbage collection 
nor reference counting is required. Objects are accessed via references 
within well-defined constraints which ensure safe parallel execution of the code.
