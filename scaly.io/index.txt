Scaly
=====

Welcome to https://github.com/rschleitzer/Scaly[_Scaly_], the _self-scaling programming language_.

Overview
--------

Scaly is a safe parallel programming language with the following features:

- code is executed in parallel where data dependencies allow
- safety against program crashes, exploits, data races and concurrency problems
- easy programming like in common mainstream languages

Scaly uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management[region-based memory management] 
where objects live on the stack. No heap is used, and therefore, neither garbage collection nor reference counting is required. Objects are accessed via references within well-defined constraints which ensure safe parallel execution of the code.

The following articles describe some aspects of Scaly:

1. link:documentation/ProgramStructure.html[Some starter documentation about the _Program Structure_]

2. link:documentation/References.html[How _references_ are used in Scaly]

3. link:documentation/ObjectAge.html[How to deal with _object age_ if required]

4. link:documentation/Structures.html[_Structures_]

C++ is used to implement https://github.com/rschleitzer/Scaly/tree/master/scaly[runtime support and standard library code] as well as for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28compilers%29[bootstrapping] the evolving https://github.com/rschleitzer/Scaly/tree/master/scalyc[compiler] till the compiler can https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting[host itself].

Building
--------

You can build Scaly taking the following steps:

1. Install http://codelite.org/[CodeLite] and run the Setup Wizard.

2. Clone the github repository:

  git clone https://github.com/rschleitzer/Scaly.git
    
3. Open `scaly.workspace` and build.

Currently, only Ubuntu 15.10 is known to build.
