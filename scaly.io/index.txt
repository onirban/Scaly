Scaly
=====

Welcome to https://github.com/rschleitzer/Scaly[_Scaly_], the _self-scaling programming language_.

Overview
--------

Scaly is a safe parallel programming language with the following features:

- enables implicit and safe parallel and distributed code execution where data dependencies allow
- safety against program crashes, exploits, data races and concurrency problems
- performance comparable to C/C++
- easy programming like in common mainstream languages

Documentation
-------------

The link:book/ScalyBook.html[_Scaly book_] is your one-stop source 
for learning how to write programs in Scaly and how to compile and run them 
using the reference implementation, and for understanding the main design points.

Building
--------

C++ is used to implement 
https://github.com/rschleitzer/Scaly/tree/master/scaly[runtime support and standard library code] 
as well as for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28compilers%29[bootstrapping] 
the evolving https://github.com/rschleitzer/Scaly/tree/master/scalyc[compiler] 
till the compiler can https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting[host itself].

You can build Scaly taking the following steps:

1. Install http://codelite.org/[CodeLite] and run the Setup Wizard.

2. Clone the github repository:

  git clone https://github.com/rschleitzer/Scaly.git
    
3. Open `scaly.workspace` and build.

Currently, only Ubuntu 15.10 is known to build.
